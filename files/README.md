The folder "runtitle" contains the full directory tree that you will need.

Its subfolders contain ".gitignore" files, so your experiment analyses should not be committed as changes if you are editing the code at the same time.

To use this directory tree, copy/paste "runtitle" and rename it to the title of your run (well, obviously!), and then edit the Matlab code to reflect this change (yeah, I wrote this back in '06/'07, wasn't so slick and automated then.)
