areal-channel-mobility
======================

These programs analyze overhead imagery to map the rate of movement of river systems, how they lose overlap with their original planforms, and how they rework the fluvial surfaces over which they move. These analyses are the basis for the work performed for [our 2013 JGR paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012JF002386) (reference below) to analyze experimental fluvial systems. They can also be used for rivers in the field.

### What does it do? Steps.

1. Import ortho-rectified photos
2. Measure the loss of planform overlap over variable time intervals
3. Measure the instantaneous rate of planform change.
4. Measure the fluvial surface reworking rate.
5. Plot.

These steps correspond to the folders with different sections of the code.

### Need help?

If you try to use this analysis routine in your work and get stuck because there is very little documentation (in spite of some good comments!), send a message to Andy Wickert, and he will take that as motivation to write better documentation.
